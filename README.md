- ## Hi there 👋
    Hey Guest, Welcome to my little home!


- ## 😶‍🌫️ Who am I ...
    I am Jishnu Bandyopadhyay, a first year M.Sc. Computer Science Student at University of Delhi (Department of Computer Science, North Campus)

    Previously, I completed my B.Sc. Computer Science (Honours.) from Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara. 

- ## 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
  - Nothing too crazy, I realized I don't have a portfolio yet. So currently working on it. Will upload and host here once done.
  - ~~Also I'm currently doing a research internship at IIEST Shibpur on Machine Learning. I will specify the topic once it is done.~~ I completed my internship on NLP, then used the knowledge and did my final year project, "Automated Exam Papaer Evaluation" with [Bitan Majumder](https://github.com/bitanM). You can check out the project [here](https://github.com/TheRealJishnu/Automated_Exam_Paper_Evaluation). You can also check the [write-up](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gn34JaVCHRcxqWlZ88yw6NEFjGhPPK2_/view?usp=drive_link).
  Don't mind the mistakes in PDF. That was my first time working in LaTeX. I realized working on a research is pretty hectic.

- ## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  The world of Artificial Intelligence is really fascinating, apart from being a buzz word, the concept is pretty mind blowing. So I'm trying to understand the basic logics of deep learning and neural network.

  I hope AGI won't take over the world before I really get into the field of AI (nervously stares at Roko's Bassilisk)...
  
- ## 🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
  Currently nothing much, but I'll update if I need anything.
- ## 💬 Ask me about ...
  Anything, I'm an open book. You can ask me about the mess in my Github, or maybe you want to tell me something. Or you can invite me to any project too. I'm not much of anything, but I'm learning.
- ## 📫 How to reach me: ...
  You can reach me through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jishnub2002/). Other social media apps? Nah I'm not really into them. To be more specific, I hate them.
- ## 😄 Pronouns: Bug/Error
  Pronouns are for ordinary people. Real programmers are known through their bugs!
- ## ⚡ Fun fact: ...
  Well as a jack of all trades, I sometimes do Competetive Programming too. Well I'm no expert, just a beginner, but I would love to chat about that.
